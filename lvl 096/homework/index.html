    <h1>ECMAScript</h1>
    <p>ECMAScript is a standard for a scripting language. It is the foundation of JavaScript and other similar languages like JScript and ActionScript. It defines the rules for how the language should work, including syntax, features, and behavior.

        Hereâ€™s a simple explanation:
        
        What it is: ECMAScript is like a rulebook for scripting languages.
        Purpose: It makes sure different environments (like browsers) understand and run JavaScript in the same way.
        Examples: JavaScript follows ECMAScript rules. When browsers update to support new ECMAScript versions, they add new JavaScript features.</p>

    <p>ECMAScript:
        Definition: ECMAScript is the standard or specification that defines how a scripting language should work.
        Purpose: It provides the guidelines and rules for languages like JavaScript to follow.
        Who makes it?: The specification is maintained by ECMA International, a standards organization.
        JavaScript:
        <ul>
        <li>Definition: JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard.</li>
        <li>Purpose: It is the actual programming language developers use to create interactive websites, apps, and more.</li>
        <li>Who makes it?: JavaScript was originally created by Netscape, but now multiple browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) implement it based on ECMAScript.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>    Key Points:    
        <li>        ECMAScript is the blueprint; JavaScript is the actual tool you use.</li>
        <li> JavaScript follows ECMAScript rules, but it may also have additional features specific to browsers or runtime environments.</li>
       <li>When ECMAScript gets updated (e.g., ES6 added features like let, const, and arrow functions), JavaScript adopts those changes over time.</li>
        
    </ul>
